code is very ugly so would be advisable not to look...
You have been warned!(⌐⊙_⊙)

coding is a hooby for me as you can tell from my nooby code, so long as i can see cool things on the screen i don't care.
but hopefully it becomes a usefull skill in the future.
learning resources used include:
"Gabor Szauer - Hands-On C++ Game Animation Programming" from packt, https://songho.ca/opengl and https://learnopengl.com.
there are some others but these are the main resources i used.
rust was a pain in the butt to use with all its constraints but im starting to enjoy it.
all the libs i used are in the toml file.
